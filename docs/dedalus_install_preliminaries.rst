Preliminaries
=============

Dedalus relies on Python3 and is distributed via a mercurial distributed
version control system. To install dedalus, first install `mercurial`_.
Then, at the command line and in an appropriate code development
directory, clone the repository. The clone command can be copied from
the ``clone`` button on the main repository page, and is also included
here::

    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/dedalus-project/dedalus2

Example problems are included in a separate repository ``examples2``
and can be cloned using::

    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/dedalus-project/examples2


(note: the ``clone`` button on the wiki pages will clone the dedalus
wiki rather than dedalus itself; they are maintained as seperate
repositories within the bitbucket system).
