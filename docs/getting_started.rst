Getting started with Dedalus
****************************

Notebook tutorials
==================

This short tutorial consists of 3 ipython notebooks.  The notebooks can be downloaded and ran interactively, or viewed online through the links below.

The first notebook introduces the ``Basis`` and ``Domain`` classes, which form the foundation of Dedalus's spectral representation of fields.

* `Tutorial 1: Bases and Domains <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/dedalus-project/dedalus/raw/tip/docs/notebooks/dedalus_tutorial_bases_domains.ipynb>`_

The second notebook introduces the ``Field`` and ``Operator`` classes, and demonstrates how to interact with and manipulate fields:

* `Tutorial 2: Fields and Operators <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/dedalus-project/dedalus/raw/tip/docs/notebooks/dedalus_tutorial_fields_operators.ipynb>`_

The third notebook introduces the ``ParsedProblem`` and ``Solver`` classes, and walks through the setup and simulation of the 1D KdV-Burgers equation:

* `Tutorial 3: Problems and Solvers <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/dedalus-project/dedalus/raw/tip/docs/notebooks/dedalus_tutorial_problems_solvers.ipynb>`_
