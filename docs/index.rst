About Dedalus
=============

Dedalus is a flexible framework for solving partial differential equations using spectral methods.

The code is open-source and developed by `a team <http://dedalus-project.org/community.html#developers>`_ of physicists and applied mathematicians working on a wide variety of problems in astrophysical and geophysical fluid dynamics.

It is written primarily in Python and features an easy-to-use interface, including text-based equation entry.

The numerical algorithm produces highly sparse systems for a wide variety of equations over spectrally-discretized domains, and these systems are efficiently solved using compiled libraries and multidimensional parallelization though MPI.
